# 🚀 Landing Page Project

A clean, responsive, and professional landing page built completely from scratch.  
This is my **first fully self-built project** published on GitHub — created without AI tools, using only my skills, practice, and dedication.

## ✨ About the Project
Originally, this project was given to me by a friend who lost interest in completing it. Instead of abandoning it, I decided to take it on as a personal challenge.  

At first, I thought it would take me much longer to finish, but with consistent effort and focus, I was able to complete it in just **four weeks**.  
This project represents more than just a landing page — it’s proof of my growth, persistence, and ability to build real projects from the ground up.
